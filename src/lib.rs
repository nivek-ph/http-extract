//! Strict, trust-aware extraction of HTTP request metadata.
//!
//! This crate operates primarily on [`http`] types and does not require a web
//! framework, Tower, tracing, or OpenTelemetry. An opt-in `axum` feature adds
//! only transport-peer extraction from Axum request extensions. Forwarding
//! fields are never trusted implicitly.
//!
//! The crate root exposes small synchronous extractors for coherent field
//! responsibilities. Applications compose only the functions they need at
//! their framework boundary; this crate does not impose a request-context
//! aggregate or an asynchronous adapter. Cargo features gate field-specific
//! APIs; disabling default features leaves the shared Header helpers and
//! [`Error`] available, and enabling a feature exposes only its documented API
//! and dependencies.
