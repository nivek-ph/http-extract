# Standards and compatibility

`http-extract` implements narrow extraction behavior derived from the stable
RFC versions below. It does not claim complete HTTP, proxy, or authentication
protocol conformance.

## IETF standards used

- [HTTP Semantics, RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html):
  [Section 5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-5) informs
  strict field handling;
  [Section 7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-7.2) covers
  request authority and `Host`;
  [Section 8.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-8.3) covers
  `Content-Type`; and
  [Section 11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-11) supplies
  the Authorization framework context. The crate only extracts these fields;
  it is not a complete HTTP implementation and does not authenticate.
- [Forwarded, RFC 7239](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7239.html): support is
  intentionally limited to the field structure in
  [Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7239.html#section-4), the
  [`for=` parameter in Section 5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7239.html#section-5.2),
  and IP node forms from
  [Section 6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7239.html#section-6.1).
  `extract_header_forwarded_for` returns a continuous IP chain and rejects
  missing, unknown, obfuscated, or non-IP nodes instead of skipping them. It
  does not implement the full Forwarded object model. Parsing and Header-based
  selection do not establish trust; deployments must account for the
  [Section 8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7239.html#section-8) security
  considerations independently.
- [Bearer Token Usage, RFC 6750 Section 2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html#section-2.1):
  the helper performs ASCII case-insensitive scheme routing and returns the raw
  credential substring. It does not validate a token or authenticate.
- [Basic Authentication, RFC 7617 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617.html#section-2):
  the helper performs ASCII case-insensitive scheme routing and returns the raw
  credential substring. It does not validate credentials, decode Base64, or
  authenticate.

## Non-standard fields

The following are common vendor or de facto fields, not IETF standards:

- `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`;
- `CF-Connecting-IP`;
- `CloudFront-Viewer-Address`;
- `Fly-Client-IP`;
- `True-Client-IP`;
- `X-Envoy-External-Address`;
- `X-Real-IP`.

Their APIs only parse raw assertions. Presence does not authenticate a proxy or
make a value suitable for access control, rate limiting, or audit use. See the
[client IP trust boundary](trusted-proxies.md) for deployment guidance.

## Rust and feature compatibility

The declared Rust baseline is Rust 1.96.0, matching `Cargo.toml`'s
`rust-version` and `rust-toolchain.toml`. This is a compiler compatibility
statement only; the core remains synchronous and framework-independent, and no
broader runtime compatibility is implied.

Default features enable all documented extraction modules. Consumers using
`default-features = false` can select only the modules they need. The exact
feature list, dependency relationships, and copyable configuration are in
[Cargo features](features.md).
